# Sprint 8 project

Project 8 by Landon Parris

In this project, I had to create javaScript code (in Visual Studio Code), and use WebdriverIO to run the test automation to test the Urban Routes web application ordering process. I used the "describe, it" method to write the tests and javascript commands such as const, await, and expect. CSS and X-path locators were used to identify website elements for the tests. The tests include setting the address, selecting the supportive plan, filling in the phone number, adding a credit card, writing a message for the driver, adding a blanket and handkerchiefs, ordering two ice creams, and waiting for the car search modal to appear. Comments have been added to seperate each test, and each test can be commented out to run individually if so desired.

Pre Conditions
1. Copy Urban Routes URL to the wdio.conf.js file in the hm08-qa-us folder
2. Run "npm install"  in your console in the hm08-qa-us folder 
3. Ensure WebdriverIO is installed 

To run tests
1. Run "npm run wdio" in the console
